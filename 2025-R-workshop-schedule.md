## 2025 R Workshop schedule


### Reading material:

Winter, B. (2019). Statistics for Linguists: An Introduction Using R (1st ed.). Routledge. https://doi.org/10.4324/9781315165547


### Format

Weekly meetings going over different sections of the book. Each week will be run by a workshop participant who will:

1. Create a .Rmd or .qmd notebook file
2. Summarise the main points / takeaways from the reading (including using code)
3. Include new examples and/or questions remaining about the reading

Participants are asked to please read the relevant sections before each workshop - the goal is for us to work through the material collaboratively. 

If you cannot attend in person, you can join via Zoom:
