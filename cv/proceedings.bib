	abstract = {Using linguistic features to detect figurative language has provided a deeper insight into figurative language. The purpose of this study is to assess whether linguistic features can help explain differences in quality of figurative language. In this study a large corpus of metaphors and sarcastic responses are collected from human subjects and rated for figurative language quality based on theoretical components of metaphor, sarcasm, and creativity. Using natural language processing tools, specific linguistic features related to lexical sophistication and semantic cohesion were used to predict the human ratings of figurative language quality. Results demonstrate linguistic features were able to predict small amounts of variance in metaphor and sarcasm production quality.},

	abstract = {Recent advances have facilitated major improvements in developing intelligent and purpose-oriented readability formulas to predict the overall difﬁculty of a text in terms of text comprehension and processing. Such readability formulas are mediating technologies that help match appropriate reading texts with students, thus enabling the development of smart learning environments that adapt learning resources to learner skills. Newer readability formulas include linguistic features that are more predictive of human judgments of text readability than traditional readability formulas, such as Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level. However, in many cases, these formulas have not been tested beyond their ability to predict reading scores. The purpose of this study is to examine the validity of newer readability models along with more traditional readability formulas using behavioral data and text comprehension scores. The results indicate that readability models employing linguistic features more theoretically related to text processing and comprehension outperform readability models that do not employ similar features. The ﬁndings support the long-term growth of readability formulas that are continuously improved to increase the wellbeing of learners.},
